# AMQ Progress Tracker Privacy Policy

## 1. Information We Collect

All information the extension collects is anything publically shown on animemusicquiz.com while you are playing a game. Nothing private will ever be accessed nor stored.

The following information is stored locally using the Chrome Storage API:

- Your amq username (to autofill the user search in the extension)
- Whether the extension is on or off

The following information is stored in the database:

- Your amq username
- The song's title, anime, artist, and song type (e.g. opening, ending)
- The link to the song's video or mp3
- What you guessed
- Whether you got it right or wrong

## 2. How information is collected

Whenever you are in a game, and a song advances from the guessing phase to the answer phase, the extension will check all appropriate elements to gather information. This information is passed via POST request to a server to be stored in the database.

## 3. What we do with the information

The data is simply used to show each user which songs they've encountered and how many times they have gotten them right or wrong.
