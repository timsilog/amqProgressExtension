# AMQ Progress Tracker Privacy Policy

## 1. Information We Collect

All information the extension collects is anything publically shown on animemusicquiz.com while you are playing a game. Nothing private will ever be accessed nor stored.

The following information is stored locally using the Chrome Storage API:

- Your amq username (to autofill the user search in the extension)
- Whether the extension is on or off

The following information is stored in the database:

- Your amq username
- The song's title, anime, artist, and song type (e.g. opening, ending)
- The link to the song's video or mp3
- What you guessed
- Whether you got it right or wrong

## 2. How information is collected

Whenever you are in a game, and a song advances from the guessing phase to the answer phase, the extension will check all appropriate elements to gather information. This information is passed via POST request to a server to be stored in the database.

## 3. What we do with the information

The data is simply used to show each user which songs they've encountered and how many times they have gotten them right or wrong. The videos/mp3's can be viewed for the user to study.
